h1. OX7 - The idea

h2. UI

* Start with empty repository
* reuse module code if it makes sense, e.g. calendar, tasks (too risky to go for full rebuild)
* eye candy (window manager; wallpaper; theming)
* light-weight (no fat framework; more "web-by"; strictly load on demand; be fast)
* focussed: remove some views, e.g. make contact v-split great; remove card view (less code; less bugs; less effort)
* app-centric: let the user decide what he/she needs; easy to extend; not all in one UI (like today)
* extensibility: create extension points (allows plugins to explicitly extend functionality; instead of hacking existing code)
* *Major Features*
** Mail thread view
** Promote plain text (additionally go for textile support if time allows that)
** Messaging (be much better than mail)
** Polish pub/sub aka social stuff (make it visible and usable)
** Favorite folders
** Photo view for infostore / Photo album publications
* Minor stuff: Use native Drag&Drop; use audio if it makes sense

h2. Server

* Keep repository & keep API (thought about changing it; but too risky because all clients, tests, documentation would get deprecated)
* Only change in API (but compatible): allow not using columns / plus: Central Dispatcher (like WebDesktop had)
* Simplified Exception Framework
* Self diagnosis
* SOAP interface rework/fixes
* Self-documenting APIs (like in WebDesktop)
* Unified OSGI Registration
* *Major Features*
** App Mgmt (mirrors UI concept)
** DB Caching (performance AND good search)
** Branding 3000
** Unified Groups
** HaloAPI

h2. Consequences

* Simplified: OX7 will be a visual merge of OX6 and WebDesktop
* Backend will (get/stay) stable - we don't want to mess around with that (think of USM, Mobile App etc.)
* The feature list is close to 6.22 plus some potential 6.24 features
* No demand for migration (rather some heavy update tasks)
* Why upgrading to OX7? You get some hot new features, you will still have the central OX6 features. Looks fresh. Better UX. Extensible.
* From the end-user perspective it deserves a generation change
