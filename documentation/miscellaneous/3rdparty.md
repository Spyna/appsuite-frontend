The field "modified" is a hint that simply updating the library to a newer version might break some feature that we depend on. Feel free to explain the details of the change, too.

Libraries that are used by the frontend, as delivered to the customer, are listed here: [List of 3rd party libraries used in the UI](http://www.open-xchange.com/licenses-ox-app-suite)
