- do not commit into develop branch directly
- please create a feature branch instead
- mind the naming conventions
- after you finished your work please create a [new merge request](https://gitlab.open-xchange.com/frontend/core/merge_requests/new)

**Branch naming conventions**

```
feature/[jira-id]_[short-description]
bug/[bugzilla-id]_[short-description]
poc/[aha-id]_[short-description]
```

git checkout -b <mybranch> develop 
```
