 * A module with which you can register for events as transmitted via the RT system. It provides the customary
 * on(eventName, callback), off(eventName, callback), once(eventName, callback) methods. To see which
 * events are available, you can check in the console with events.protectedMethods.backend.events().done(function (supported) { console.log(supported);});
 * Use this only, if the 'rt' capability is present.
