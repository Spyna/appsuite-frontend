					When developing the OX7 frontend we chose to forego more complex widget based libraries in favor of direct DOM manipulations and in favor of plain old HTML and CSS. This gives us a lot of flexibility and since, philosophically, OX7 aims to be a citizen of the web, and not simulate desktop apps, it seems wise to stay close to web technologies. This means, to create the visuals of any piece of the OX7 frontend, you need to manipulate the DOM structure. You'll need a good understanding of <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> as well as a good understanding of <strong>JQuery</strong>, since we use this pretty much everywhere, and so will you. Also, knowing this has never hurt anyones resum√©. If you've already worked with JQuery you can probably skip this tutorial, everyone else, please stay around for a whirlwind tour of JQuery DOM manipulation, element navigation and event handling.

				<h2>Creating a structure </h2>
				<p>
					To create a dom node in JQuery simply call the <code>$</code> function with the html text that describes your node:
					<div class="code"> var theDiv = $("&lt;div&gt;"); </div>
