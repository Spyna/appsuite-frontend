# Distinction

**Capabilities**

The covers more global configurations with its simple enabled/disabled states. For example the capability _tasks_ controlls the availability of the task app.

**Settings**

Settings in opposite are more flexible (more than true/false) and tend to affect the ui in more subtable ways.
