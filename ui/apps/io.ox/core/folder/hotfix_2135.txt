=========

Title: [L3] Mail module shows images of mails in the spam folder
Description:
The mail app has a user-setting to block external images (allowHtmlImages). This bug is about *not* blocking external images in general but only in the spam folder.

If allowHtmlImages = true, the UI will load external images for all folder except the configured spam folder.
If allowHtmlImages = false, the UI will never load external images (showing a button instead).

Bug 34294
=========

Title: Javascript files not minimized during grunt dist
Description:
The build configuration is setup in a way, that `grunt dist` will not produce any minified javascript files. The original files will be created, instead. This has been fixed in the shared grunt config with the 0.6.3 release. This has mainly been an issue for the core-ui, because the dist task has been customized. The 0.6.3 of shared-grunt-config provides better filters for files being copied around.
