# Special configuration settings

__io.ox/mail//features/alwaysDeleteDraft__

_values: true/false_

This setting is used when drafts should always be deleted when sending them.
This is useful if you don't want to manually delete your not needed drafts. 
Keep in mind that this will affect every draft, with this setting drafts that were used as templates will also be deleted when sending.
