    * with another task definition. It will be performed once this task has been completed. Use #when to get hold of a deferred object that is resolved once the task is done.
    * #start begins the task execution and returns the deferred for this task object. #start can be called multiple times, only the first call will trigger the taskDefs perform method
    * subsequent calls return the already resolved deferred object instead.
